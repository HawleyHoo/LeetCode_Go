# [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

## 题目

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:

```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
```
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.


## 题目大意

2 个逆序的链表，要求从低位开始相加，得出结果也逆序输出，返回值是逆序结果链表的头结点。

需要注意的是各种进位问题。

极端情况，例如
```
Input: (9 -> 9 -> 9 -> 9 -> 9) + (1 -> )
Output: 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1
```
